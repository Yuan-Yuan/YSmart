The simplest way to try YSmart is as follows.

Step 1: install YSmart using the following command:

python setup.py install

Step 2: translate a TPC-H query using the following command:

python translation.py tpch_test/17.sql tpch_test/tpch.schema


The outputs of the translation are: (1) the JAVA codes in YSmartCode and (2) a file testquery.script that is the execution script. However, the default YSmart does not compile or execute its generated codes unless some configuration options are turned on. Detailes are in readme.txt.

Good Luck!
