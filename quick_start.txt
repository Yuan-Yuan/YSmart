* System Requirements

Make sure you have Python 2.7 (not Python 3) installed system.
You need Antlr3 runtime libraries for python. You can get then from 

```bash
$ pip install antlr_python_runtime
```
Or download and install it from here:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/antlr_python_runtime/3.1.3

The simplest way to translate SQL queries to Hadoop jobs is to use the following command:
$ python translation.py </path/to/the/sql/query> </path/to/the/database/schema>

* How to install

To install simply downlaod and extract the source code and then run this command

```bash
$ python setup.py install 
```

* An Example

As an example:
$ sq2mapred tests/ysmart/test/tpch_test/tpch18query.sql tests/ysmart/test/tpch_test/tpch18query.sql

This command saves the generated Hadoop jobs in the  ./result directory, which contains
(1) the Java source codes in the ./result/YSmartCode. 
(2) A ./result/testquery.script file that contains commands to compile and execute the generated Hadoop jobs.

* Notes

YSmart does not compile or execute the generated jobs unless relevant configuration options are turned on.
Details are in readme.txt.

Good Luck!
