The simplest way to translate SQL queries to Hadoop jobs is to use the following command:
$ python translation.py </path/to/the/sql/query> </path/to/the/database/schema>

As an example:
$ python translation.py test/tpch_test/17.sql test/tpch_test/tpch.schema

This command saves the generated Hadoop jobs in the  ./result directory, which contains
(1) the Java source codes in the ./result/YSmartCode. 
(2) A ./result/testquery.script file that contains commands to compile and execute the generated Hadoop jobs.

Note: YSmart does not compile or execute the generated jobs unless relevant configuration options are turned on.
Details are in readme.txt.

Good Luck!
